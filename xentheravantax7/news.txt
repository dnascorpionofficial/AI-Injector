"Updated Battery Usage Pattern Cycle"
I have updated this via online on x7 all build
'so what you guys have to do'
"Only one time have to do this on any x7 build"
first turn off your all modules in your root manager (No need to uninstall or reboot after turning off - just turn off) then completely drain your battery & let it switch off automatically
then keep trying to restart alot times until the screen fully black and no response
connect charger & restart your device, it may take sometime to restart,keep the charger connected and charge to 100%. after charge 100% turn on all your modules you have and do a reboot without removing the charger- After reboot keep charging for atleast 10 minutes in 100% charge. done
